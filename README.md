# boluscareportal

This is a _beta_ test release of an app that helps you determine a bolus dose for insulin based on carbs, BG, IOB, and a carb. ratio and BG correction profile you setup.  It reads your current CGM BG from Nightscout and IOB from Nightscout-Careportal, and you can see results of the calculations in realtime, separately for carb. and correction, as well as your current profile settings.  Once you have finished changing the values, it will also send all the data to your Careportal site so your IOB will be ready for the next bolus.

The beta version currently only works with mg/dl.

Note that it has been tested very little, and you absolutely must not rely solely on it to calculate your insulin dosage.  Insulin can be a dangerous medicine and this calculation should not be taken lightly.  However, it is also a required and burdensome calculation to make, that may be needed several times a day, and is very prone to human error regardless of the method.

Please send any comments (with details and screenshots as possible) to the Pebble app store contact link.

This app is built on open source software (Careportal watchapp), sources are available on request.
